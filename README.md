# Escape from the Troll's Cave

By Garry Francis

## Background

Woe is you! You've wagged school and spent all day at the carnival and you've run out of money. You were wandering around a quiet area behind all the main rides when you came across a sign over an entrance that said 'Administration'. The sign had been crossed out and replaced with 'Troll's Cave - Admission Free'. What a great gimmick! You couldn't resist the temptation of a free ride, so you were lured inside.

Big mistake.

Little did you know that this really was an administration area and not a ride at all. There's a troll at the exit that won't let you leave until you pay his toll, but you haven't got a cent to your name because you spent it all on fairy floss and the other rides. You need to find some money and pay the troll to return to your dull (but safe) existence outside the carnival.

Luckily for you, trolls have no pockets, so they tend to drop coins everywhere. If you look around carefully, there's a good chance that you may be able to find the money you need to pay the troll and get out of here.

This is a traditional text adventure based on 'Cave of the Troll' by John H Doolittle. The game is hosted at [Escape from the Troll's Cave](https://drdooriddle.itch.io/escape-from-the-trolls-cave).
